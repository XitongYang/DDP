// Assuming we have a button on the website with an ID 'bookButton'

1. Locate the 'Book' button on the website
   button = findElementById('bookButton')

2. Define the URL or integration point for the third-party ordering system
   thirdPartyURL = 'https://third-party-ordering.com/book-now'

3. Add an event listener to the 'Book' button for the 'click' event
   button.addEventListener('click', function() {

4. On clicking the 'Book' button, redirect the user to the third-party system
      redirectTo(thirdPartyURL)
   })

// Function to redirect user to a specified URL
function redirectTo(url) {
   window.location.href = url
}

// Optionally, if the third-party system supports it, you might pass additional parameters in the URL
// For example, if you can pre-fill the booking form with the date, time, or service type, you might construct the URL as follows:
// thirdPartyURL = 'https://third-party-ordering.com/book-now?date=2024-02-02&service=ServiceType'

// Remember to replace 'https://third-party-ordering.com/book-now' with the actual URL provided by the third-party system
// And modify parameters (e.g., 'date', 'service') according to the third-party system's requirements
